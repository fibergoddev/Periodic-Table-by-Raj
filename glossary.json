  "phase": "The state of matter at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP): Solid, Liquid, or Gas.",
  "electronegativity_pauling": "A measure of the tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons. The Pauling scale is the most commonly used.",
  "electron_configuration": "The distribution of electrons of an atom or molecule in atomic or molecular orbitals. It describes where the electrons are located around the nucleus.",
